        <p>
          Love is a special bond that can help you sail through the most
          brutal storms of life. In you, my baby, I have found a support
          thatâ€™s unwavering and unconditional. No matter where we stay, I always
          know you are the one I can always count on. So, a big thank you to you
          for being my partner for life!

          When the storm of the future comes to test our bond, the road seems
          rocky, and the distance threatens to tear us apart, I am sure the
          memories we build together now will be strong enough to help us win
          over these challenges and keep our love strong forever.

        <p>
          Each passing day helps us grow more and more. The more I know
          your beautiful soul, the more I fall for it. You are my special one,
          the one I will choose over everyone else. My Baby, I love you from the core of my heart. We met by
          chance, and now we are partners by choice. You are the best thing
          that ever happened to me. I am grateful to God a thousand times for
          bringing you into my life and making me complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got so attached to you because you never judged me even when you
          didnâ€™t know me well. Thanks for believing in me. Thanks for nurturing
          the love we have with your precious time and efforts. You make me feel
          so secure and loved. I love you so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          These past few days have been amazing, the amount of experiences we had 
          were uncountable and I'd love to have my life filled with the same. I would
          love to spend my life with you and extend what we had for these few days
          to our entire lives.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 5)">
        <p>
          You stayed with me and managed to stick around when others
          could have simply left. You made me what I am today. I canâ€™t tell you
          how blessed I feel to be around you. Thank you for everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have taught me so much and always wished the best for me. You are
          one of the biggest reasons I could find my calling and follow my
          dreams. I must have done some good deeds in my previous life because,
          in this one, I have found a gem of a partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have touched my soul and made my life so valuable and joyful. With
          all the laughter and memories, you have added life to our friendship 
          and our relationship. I can hardly imagine a life without you, my precious one.
          We donâ€™t get to meet often, but I think of you all the time. My brain feels empty without you in it.
          You are irreplaceable in my life, and I love you so much.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 6)">
        <p>
          Frankly, I can keep talking about you all day and night, and still be
          left with a million more things to say. You are the most amazing
          individual I have ever met. And I cannot envision my life without you
          in it. You are one of the greatest treasures of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I miss you a lot re, It feels so difficult to stay away. There's very 
          few things we can do to keep each other happy when we're so far away.
          The past few days felt like a dream that brushed past and now we are 
          back to being far away, but, we've got this. This is one of the few things
          that I can do to strengthen out relationship while being so far away.
          It's really difficult to be without you, to be able to see you but not be able
          to hug you. I really wish everything turns around and we get a chance to be together
          without being on borrowed time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="page text-page">
        <p>
          I adore you for everything you are, for all of our happy memories
          together, for our supportive interactions, and for all the ways you
          have helped me grow. I wouldnâ€™t have it any other way because a love
          like you is rare to find and I cherish you a lot. I love you, my babudi.
        </p>

        <p>You are My Everything ðŸ’–.</p>
